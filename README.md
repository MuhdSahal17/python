I’m a 3rd year Diploma student in Computer Engineering, currently improving my skills in Python programming, computer science fundamentals, and the basics of Machine Learning.

I learn through small projects, daily practice, and consistent skill building.
Right now, my main focus is becoming strong in Python, understanding programming logic, and learning the fundamentals of ML step by step.
